Samaritan
=========

A certain _Samaritan_, as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, take care of him.

As the good Samaritan of men, so too comes a good Samaritan for developers. The Samaritan is compassionate and caring... thinking of what he can do for another man. To be as a caretaker, not a hinderence; there when you need him.
